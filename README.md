# C++ Sample Programs

## Requirements for Building

* CMake 3.16 (random untested choice that should work)
* C++ 17 compatible compiler

## Project Setup

You can use cmake from the command line to setup the project using CMake. It's just an example of setting up the program; the choice of build directory and generator is yours.

```
mkdir build
cmake -S . -B build 
```
